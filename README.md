<h1> Modified Nodal Analysis </h1>

<p> The main code is graph.py, run with `python3 graph.py`

Dependencies:
  1. numpy https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html
  2. tkinter https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter</p> 
  
  
<h2> Early stage </h2> 

  <p> The application is still under develop, the main algorithm is complete but we are working to make it more user friendly </p>


## Example 

![example](https://i.imgur.com/6SzehSL.png)

* A Red node is a resistance
* Yellow node is voltage
* Red circle is positive reference point
* Blue circle is negative reference point

The result for this simulation would be a difference in voltage of 6 between the two references, each resistance has a different value.
